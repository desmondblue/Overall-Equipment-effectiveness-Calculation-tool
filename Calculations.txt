Capacity Utilization – B / A

Availability – C / B

Performance – { (Volume produced Good + Rejection Volume) x 1000/ Speed}/ C

Quality – Volume produced good/( Vol produced good + Volume rejected)

OEE	= AR*PR*QR

Standard Manpower productivity = (Loading Time X Speed) / Std. Manpower    

Actual Manpower Productivity = Actual Production / Actual Manpower Deployed 

For Machine Productivity at 80%:
Target Production = Speed x Loading Time x 80% 
Machine Productivity at 80% = {(Actual Production/Target Production) x 100}%

Man –Power Deployment
Then % of Man-power productivity level = Actual Manpower Productivity / Standard Manpower Productivity.
 This implies, if % of manpower productivity level is >100% whereas Manpower deployment is<100%, then it will be good for factory. 

Calculated Value Operating Time
(Volume Produced Good+ Reject)*1000/Design Speed
Un-Accounted Time = Value Operating Time – Calculated Value Operating Time

Mean Time between Failure
(Loading Time – Down time Loss)/ Number of Equipment Breakdown

Mean Time to Repair
Sum of Time stops for failure / Number of Equipment Breakdown
